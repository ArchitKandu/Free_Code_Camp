                    <p>As its official tagline states, React is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a framework - it's not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments. For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications.</p><br> 
                    <p>To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM. React and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same spaces as — and utilized to solve the same problems as — other true web development frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", we're working with that colloquial understanding</p><br> 
                    <p>React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. It does this through the use of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a portion of the user interface. These components can be composed together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the rendering work, leaving you to concentrate on the UI design.</p><br>

                    <header>Use Cases</header>
                    <p>Unlike the other frameworks covered in this module, React does not enforce strict rules around code conventions or file organization. This allows teams to set conventions that work best for them, and to adopt React in any way they would like to. React can handle a single button, a few pieces of an interface, or an app's entire user interface.</p><br>
                    <p>While React can be used for small pieces of an interface, it's not as easy to "drop into" an application as a library like jQuery, or even a framework like Vue — it is more approachable when you build your entire app with React.</p><br>
                    <p>In addition, many of the developer-experience benefits of a React app, such as writing interfaces with JSX, require a compilation process. Adding a compiler like Babel to a website makes the code on it run slowly, so developers often set up such tooling with a build step. React arguably has a heavy tooling requirement, but it can be learned.</p><br>
                    <p>This article is going to focus on the use case of using React to render the entire user interface of an application, using tooling provided by Facebook's own create-react-app tool.</p><br>
                </section>

                <section class="main-section" id="react_use_javascript">
                    <header>React use JavaScript</header>
                    <p>React utilizes features of modern JavaScript for many of its patterns. Its biggest departure from JavaScript comes with the use of JSX syntax. JSX extends JavaScript's syntax so that HTML-like code can live alongside it. For example:</p><br>
                    <code>const heading = &lt;h1&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/h1&gt;;<br></code><br>
                    <p>This heading constant is known as a JSX expression. React can use it to render that &lt;h1&gt; tag in our app.</p><br>
                    <p>Suppose we wanted to wrap our heading in a &lt;header&gt; tag, for semantic reasons? The JSX approach allows us to nest our elements within each other, just like we do with HTML:</p><br>
                    <code>const header = (<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;header&gt;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/h1&gt;;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/header&gt;<br>
                        );<br>
                    </code><br>
                    <p>Of course, your browser can't read JSX without help. When compiled (using a tool like Babel or Parcel), our header expression would look like this:</p><br>
                    <code>const header = React.createElement("header", null,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;React.createElement("h1", null, "Mozilla Developer Network")<br>
                    );<br></code><br>
                    <p>It's possible to skip the compilation step and use React.createElement() to write your UI yourself. In doing this, however, you lose the declarative benefit of JSX, and your code becomes harder to read. Compilation is an extra step in the development process, but many developers in the React community think that the readability of JSX is worthwhile. Plus, modern front-end development almost always involves a build process anyway — you have to downlevel modern syntax to be compatible with older browsers, and you may want to minify your code to optimize loading performance. Popular tooling like Babel already comes with JSX support out-of-the-box, so you don't have to configure compilation yourself unless you want to.</p><br>
                    </p>Because JSX is a blend of HTML and JavaScript, some developers find it intuitive. Others say that its blended nature makes it confusing. Once you're comfortable with it, however, it will allow you to build user interfaces more quickly and intuitively, and allow others to better understand your codebase at a glance.</p><br>

                    <p>In order to use create-react-app, you need to have Node.js installed. It's recommended that you use the long-term support (LTS) version. Node includes npm (the node package manager), and npx (the node package runner).</p><br>
                    <p>You may also use the Yarn package manager as an alternative, but we'll assume you are using npm in this set of tutorials. See Package management basics for more information on npm and yarn.</p><br>    
                    <p>If you're using Windows, you will need to install some software to give you parity with Unix/macOS terminal in order to use the terminal commands mentioned in this tutorial. Gitbash (which comes as part of the git for Windows toolset) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) are both suitable. See Command line crash course for more information on these, and on terminal commands in general.</p><br>    
                    <p>Also bear in mind that React and ReactDOM produce apps that only work on a fairly modern set of browsers — IE9+ by way of some polyfills. It is recommended that you use a modern browser like Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Chrome when working through these tutorials.</p><br>

                    <p>This brings us to the end of our initial look at React, including how to install it locally, creating a starter app, and how the basics work. In the next article, we'll start building our first proper application — a todo list. Before we do that, however, let's recap some of the things we've learned.</p><br>
                    <p>In React:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Components can import modules they need and must export themselves at the bottom of their files.</li>
                        <li>Component functions are named with <code>PascalCase</code>.</li>
                        <li>You can read JSX variables by putting them between curly braces, like <code>{so}</code>.</li>
                        <li>Some JSX attributes are different than HTML attributes so that they don't conflict with JavaScript reserved words. For example, <code>class</code> in HTML translates to <code>className</code> in JSX. Note that multi-word attributes are in <code>camelCase.</code></li>
                        <li>Props are written just like attributes inside component calls and are passed into components.</li>
                    </ul>
