            <ul id="lists">
                <li><span id="des-points">Hawk Eyes: </span>A wound that'd make an ordinary man unconscious... I won't lose to it. A wound that would kill an ordinary person... I won't lose to it! To face one who is extraordinary, Hawk Eyes... I can't allow myself to be ordinary!</li>
                <li><span id="des-points">Boredom: </span>You want to kill me? You couldn't even kill my boredom!</li>
                <li><span id="des-points">If I Die Here: </span>If I die here, then I'm a man that could only make it this far!</li>
                <li><span id="des-points">Being Strong: </span>Being strong isn't just about having power or move, it about one's spirit!</li>
                <li><span id="des-points">Acceptance: </span>You need to accept the fact that you're not the best and have all the will to strive to be better than anyone you face!</li>
                <li><span id="des-points">I Don't Care: </span>I don't care what the society says. I've regretted doing anything. I will survive and do what I want to!</li>
                <li><span id="des-points">Even One Step Back: </span>I don't know. I'm not sure why myself. But if I were to take even one step back, I believe that all those important oaths, promises and many other deals 'til now, will all go to waste and I'll never be able to return before you, ever again!</li>
                <li><span id="des-points">Discarded My Life: </span>When I decided to follow my dream, I had already discarded my life!</li>
                <li><span id="des-points">There Is Someone: </span>There is someone that I must meet again. And until that day...not even Death itself can take my life away!</li>
                <li><span id="des-points">Shoves You Around: </span>When the world shoves you around, you just gotta stand up and shove back. It's not like somebody's gonna save you if you start babbling excuses!</li>
